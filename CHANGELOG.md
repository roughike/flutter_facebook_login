## 3.0.0
* Update Android & iOS Facebook Login dependencies to `5.5`
* Removed deprecated method `loginWithPublishPermissions` and renamed `loginWithReadPermission` to `login`
* The `behavior` parameter is now ignored on iOS as it is not supported anymore by the Facebook Login SDK
* #122: Fix expiration date crashes in 32-bit iOS devices.
* Bump iOS deployment target to `9.0`

## 2.0.1

* [#128](https://github.com/roughike/flutter_facebook_login/pull/128): Pin down FBSDKCoreKit to the same version as FBSDKLoginKit.

## 2.0.0

* **Breaking change:** migrate from the deprecated original Android Support Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also migrate](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility) if they're using the original support library.

## 1.2.0

* Update Android & iOS Facebook Login dependencies
* Fix failing `equals()` in `FacebookAccessToken`
* Fix "could not find class 'android.view.autofill.AutofillManager'" error on Android
* Fix the "{com.facebook.sdk:FBSDKErrorDeveloperMessageKey=Unknown error building URL.}" error on iOS
* Add `FacebookAccessToken#isValid()` for checking if the access token is expired or not

**Breaking change:**

The `FacebookLogin#isLoggedIn` now checks if the `currentAccessToken` is expired or not, while it previously only checked if `currentAccessToken` was non-null.

## 1.1.1

* Fix occasional hangs/freezes by introducing a slight artifical delay after getting the result from Facebook login.
